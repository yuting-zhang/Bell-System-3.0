Please just be tolerant; the code was written when I did not even not what Computer Science is.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n+ Customizable time table. You can select how many classes are there on each day and what they are. You can also set the start and end time for each single class. \r\n+ Customizable ring tone. You can select different ring tones for different classes. The ring tone for the beginning of a class and the end of a class can also be different. \r\n\r\n## Video Walk-through\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/bspIl1t.gifv)\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\n\r\nThe background image I used is a snapshot from Project Diva.
